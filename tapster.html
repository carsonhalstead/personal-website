    <div class="brief" >
      
      <h2 >Objective</h2>

        Brand and launch Tapster’s alcohol delivery and keg retrieval service.
      </p>
      <h2 >Approach</h2>

      <h3 >Branding</h3>
      <p >
        Tapster's voice and visual language were born from competitive analysis, audience research, and rounds of creative concepting.
        The analysis of lookalike experiences gave the team comparable apps to learn from.
      </p>

      <h3 >App Teardown</h3>
      <p >
        We had a functioning prototype to test the end-to-end customer journey.
        I built a “birdseye” view of the app to benchmark flows that help users accomplish tasks.
        The audit revealed where to focus our efforts.

        alt="Dry erase sketches in front of foamcore in the background." />
    </div>

    <div class="case-module" >

      <h3 >Requirements</h3>
      <p >
        From the audit we were able to extract valuable jobs-to-be-done.
        These tasks were documented in the form of user stories, written from the perspective of three personas crafted from initial audience research.
        Two user story creation workshops prompted company-wide participation.

    </div>

    <div class="case-module" >

      <p >
        I worked with INPHANTRY’s Creative Director to organize user stories into epics based on task flows.
        When our seven week production timeline was reduced to five, we had to cut out a few proposed features.
        We decided to reduce product discovery, specifically filtering and recommendations, to concentrate on ordering flows.

        alt="Wireframes show a product in the cart on the left, a checkout screen in the center, and options to change or add an address on the right." />
      <img src="images/tapster-case-pdp.jpg"
        alt="Phone screens display a product description page with available sizes and stores and product details." />
    </div>

    <div class="case-module" >

      <h3 >Leadership</h3>
      <p >
        I was on point for daily standups, coordinating the development team around progress and blockers.
        I led weekly client presentations to share new wireflows and validate assumptions with stakeholders.
        Approved flows allowed the team to apply Tapster’s new brand identity to the UI.
      </p>
      <p >
        It was refreshing to step away from visual design decisions and support the Junior Designer’s vision through internal review.
        This allowed us to reveal design on a rolling basis while I drew up the next phase of wireflows.
      </p>

        alt="Welcome screen with location permission prompt for new users flanked by order summary screens." />
    </div>

    <div class="case-module" >
      
      <h3 >Ongoing Testing</h3>
      <p >
        We frequently shared unfinished work so that stakeholders had a voice in the process.
        Since we were our own QA team, I was installing new builds and tracking bugs in between design work and presentations.
        A shapeshifting schedule ultimately led us to a successful app store submission and thus, the MVP was launched.
